    - (Mosaic &amp; Centennial) The addition of centennial and biscuit malt is a weird
      combination, the beer has a heinekin skunky taste to it, could also be because

    - Excellent aroma but a bit on the bitter side.  IBUs should be reduced to the
      upper 70s or lower 80s.  Malt, hops,and color do not reflect actual nugget nectar
      very well but a good tasting beer - placed 2nd in the Hop Blossom 2015 IPA category.
    - An attempt at a Nugget Nectar clone but misses the mark.  A very good tasting
      IPA though.

    - 2nd attempt at making a Red Rye IPA.  Efficiency was very low - 62%, may have
      affected color.  Seemed overly bitter and there was probably too much rye in
      the batch.  The keg also had too much hops sludge in the bottom when it was
      emptied.
    - Medium spicy IPA made with Rye and Wheat malts.  Hopped and dry hopped primarily
      with Cascade along with some Amarillo Gold and Chinook.
